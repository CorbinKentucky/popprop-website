  <!-- Story of PopProp City -->
  <div class="story">
    <h2>The Tale of PopProp City</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a city built on honest Real-World Assets (RWA) – solid houses and business buildings, each symbolizing true value: a small house, softly glowing, represented modest but secure ownership; a towering office building embodied large enterprises, and in between resided more residential and commercial blocks, all together forming the backbone of this city.</p>
    <p>But one day, a mysterious glow appeared behind the clouds: the radiant Solana logo, shimmering in purple and neon green beams across the sky. Under this light, a soft whisper stirred in the bushes – three cats scurried out, their eyes bright and curious, as if they had caught the digital murmurs of the internet.</p>
    <p>Then Pepe, the mischievous frog, appeared with a broad grin and sparkling eyes. He was the epitome of a meme, the essence of the internet: playful, spontaneous, and unpredictable. “Hello, dear city of RWA!” Pepe called out. “I am the meme – light as air yet powerful enough to make entire online worlds dance.”</p>
    <p>Hesitantly, the buildings opened their large, friendly eyes. The little house chuckled: “What are you doing here, you colorful frog?” Pepe hopped closer and sat on the edge of a bush. “I want to make your solid world swing a little. With a touch of humor, virality, and creative energy!”</p>
    <p>The office towers leaned in curiously. “Creative energy?” they murmured. “What will that trigger?” Pepe winked and spun a thread of ideas: NFTs as digital mementos of our city, community events where meme competitions bring together real investors and fans, and even small grants (“Meme-Grants”) to support daring artists working at the intersection of reality and virality.</p>
    <p>At that moment, a beam from the Solana logo hit the roof of the largest block. An electrifying glow spread through the city: smart contracts making goods movement transparent, tokens breaking real assets into small, tradable fractions, and meme-dApps giving each transaction a playful twist.</p>
    <p>The cats meowed in approval, Pepe clapped his hands (or rather, his froggy hands) with excitement, and the buildings breathed a sigh of relief. A new era began, where hard values and light-hearted humor walked hand in hand – real assets and memes merged into something greater than both: a vibrant, creative economy offering both stability and playfulness.</p>
    <p>Thus, RWA met Meme, Solana provided the drive, and the city awakened to a colorful, harmonious hum – ready to conquer the world with its unique blend of substance and fun.</p>
